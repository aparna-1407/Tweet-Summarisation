    "reference = [\"\"\"England win the toss in the 5th and final T20I and opt to field first. Rohit and Virat open for India. Rohit completes 50 with a six. Chris Jordan takes a beautiful one handed catch and gets Rohit out while Virat Kohli, runs from 34 balls with four 4s and five 6s. What a perfect start India has made, this also goes on to show this is as poor as England have ever bowled in a major T20 match. Finally, a brilliant catch by Roy.That's the powerplay done and dusted and a good one despite losing a wicket.Virat Kohli brings up his half century, and stands not out at 80 runs. Fantastic innings from the India batsman. India post 224/2 in 20 overs, England needs 225 to win.Another big over and the match has gone in control of England.Good first innings total- especially the first over wicket by India! Hope Indian bowlers wonâ€™t mess the chase . Malan is in great touch today. Good over considering these two batsmen, two more overs like these will surely put pressure on Batting. Bhuvi comes into the attack and takes the important wicket of Buttler. That wicket is actually good for England as Bairstow was going nowhere fast. Shardul Thakur takes a wicket at the right time. Seems like Malan is out of the ground, and India immediately get two wickets! Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been sensational today having cleaned up Jason Roy and Buttler. England are five wickets down for 142.Brilliant bowling on a solid batting pitch.England needs 62 runs from 12 balls to win the match. India won the match and series as well. Well played India! India win the 5th T20I by 36 runs and have clinched the five-match T20I series 3-2. Virat Kohli remained unbeaten on 80 (52 balls) as India posted 224/2 in 20 overs and won Player Of the Series.\"\"\"]\n",

    "reference = [\"\"\"England win the toss in the 5th and final T20I and opt to field first. Rohit and Virat open for India. Rohit completes 50 with a six. Chris Jordan takes a beautiful one handed catch and gets Rohit out while Virat Kohli, runs from 34 balls with four 4s and five 6s. What a perfect start India has made, this also goes on to show this is as poor as England have ever bowled in a major T20 match. Finally, a brilliant catch by Roy.That's the powerplay done and dusted and a good one despite losing a wicket.Virat Kohli brings up his half century, and stands not out at 80 runs. Fantastic innings from the India batsman. India post 224/2 in 20 overs, England needs 225 to win.Another big over and the match has gone in control of England.Good first innings total- especially the first over wicket by India! Hope Indian bowlers wonâ€™t mess the chase . Malan is in great touch today. Good over considering these two batsmen, two more overs like these will surely put pressure on Batting. Bhuvi comes into the attack and takes the important wicket of Buttler. That wicket is actually good for England as Bairstow was going nowhere fast. Shardul Thakur takes a wicket at the right time. Seems like Malan is out of the ground, and India immediately get two wickets! Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been sensational today having cleaned up Jason Roy and Buttler. England are five wickets down for 142.Brilliant bowling on a solid batting pitch.England needs 62 runs from 12 balls to win the match. India won the match and series as well. Well played India! India win the 5th T20I by 36 runs and have clinched the five-match T20I series 3-2.
